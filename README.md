A simple library for building datasets. Much of the code has been taken directly from [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).

Does only a few simple things. Optimized for readability.

### Installation

cd into a directory where you would like to git clone the repository and execute the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:radekosmulski/zen_dataset.git
pip install -e zen_dataset
```

and you should be all set. This will perform a [pip editable](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs) installation. You should be able to import `zen_dataset` now, also any changes to the code in the repo (either via pulling or made directly) should be picked up upon subsequent imports.
